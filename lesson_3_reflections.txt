When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It allow to share my work and so anyone can collaborate to my project and make it evolve.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I'm developing new features on my local repositery and, at the same time, somebody add feature to GitHub repositery (or remote repositery), I want not that the new features on GitHub cames to my local repositery since it can create a bug in my code. I would prefer check th GitHub code before to synchronize both of the repositeries.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Fork create a copy of a repositery directly on your github account. So, contributors of the original repositery is/are still present in your fork repositery.
    - clone create a copy of a repositery directly on your local machine. So, contributors of the original repositery is/are still present in your fork repositery.
    - branches allow to manage branche in your local or online repositery. But after each modification on any branch, you need to push or pull the commit to synchronize respectively your online/github repositery or local repositery.

stored locally?
